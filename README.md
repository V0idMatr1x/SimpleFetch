SimpleFetch is a lightweight script that I wrote for fun, and it was an attempt to make a bare-bones implementation of Neofetch written in Python3. Neofetch is obviously my favorite, and is clearly a better option. Neofetch is much more complex, and provides a lot more functionality! Here is a link if you want to try it out! [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) 

This was a fun experiment, and I learned quite a bit making it!
